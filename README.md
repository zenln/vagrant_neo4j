# Vagrant == Install Neo4j #

- This repo contains vagrant script to install neo4j and portfordward vagrant box port 7474 to host.
- You will need to install vagrant and a vagrant supported hypervisor to run this [ Virtualbox recommended ]

## Installation ##

- Download this repo
- Navigate to this repo from your terminal
- vagrant up 
- And you are ready to go
- * Note * you may have to wait a while before neo4j starts because of the RAM on the machine it takes a while. You may increase the  RAM setting on the machine accordingly.
- ** Note ** I am have put a static version of neo4j and java in file since I was hoping to reduce network traffing in a demonstration. In the future I will have this removed and you will may have to download this from the vendor site.
